  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    I am Chris Blackburn, a.k.a Midwire. I manage a remote-only Ruby consulting company, <a href="http://midwiretech.com">Midwire Technologies.</a>
    I've been writing software since 1989. I've loved computers and technology since I first saw Star Trek and Lost in Space. I use this space to occasionally write about programming computers and other techie things.
