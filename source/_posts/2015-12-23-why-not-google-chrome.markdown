## Why you should not use the Google Chrome browser

As an internet software engineer, I often get asked why I don't use Google's ever popular Chrome browser. My answer is often met with disbelief. So I decided to answer the question once and for all with proof behind my reasoning in this six and a half minute video.

<iframe width="640" height="360" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" src="https://www.bitchute.com/embed/45aYkUCnlVYA/"></iframe>

I posted the video on youtube back in August of 2015. An interesting fact is that it is virtually impossible to find the video using a Google search or a Youtube specific search. Google refuses to index the video. If this doesn't confirm the nefariousness behind the Chrome browser what will? Will Google simply remove the video? Probably. I propose they will remove it if it begins to gain any traction.

Update: Google has removed the original video posted on Youtube.  You can now <a href="https://www.bitchute.com/video/45aYkUCnlVYA/">find it on bitchute</a>.

Try this: Do a search for "why not google chrome" or "why you shouldn't use the chrome browser". I'm betting that you will not find a single article or video that exposes their tracking as I do in the linked video. You will most certainly not find my video.

**The clear fact is that Google tracks your every move when you use their browser. They don't want you to know that.**

If you want a browser experience without sharing every site you visit and single click you make with Google, [use Firefox](http://getfirefox.com).

In addition, I use [startpage.com](https://startpage.com/) instead of google.com for all of my searching. Startpage gets their results from Google but they don't record your searches and correlate your IP address, etc.

Good luck
